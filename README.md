# On the list coloring of 1-band buffering cellular graphs
KTH Royal Institute of Technology — II2202, Fall 2017, Period 1-2

<p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> The optimal channel allocation problem in cellular networks is often formulated in a graph theoretic framework. One of its variants–where each access point knows the list of its free channels–is related to the so-called list coloring problem. In spite of the fact that the list coloring problem is NP-complete for arbitrary graphs, we show that there exists a polynomial time algorithm for 1-band buffering callular graphs; and as a corollary it turns out the choice number of such a graphs is at most 4. In addition, we carried out performance comparisons between the existing integer linear programming solution and our implementation. </p>
